Cortex, being a Distributed, Multi-Tenant Prometheus off-loads the storage to battle-tested databases like Cassandra, BigTable, etc. All the time-series data is converted into chunks. The chunk store essentially contains two parts i.e Index Store, where index to the chunks are stored & KV Store for the chunks itself for direct access. For Index store, There are multiple types of schemas supported by passing the relevant config through `chunk.SchemaConfig`. Right now, there are only some storage backends supported but as we are seeing more and more users adopting Cortex in their companies,iItâ€™s important that there is a way for them to extend Cortex to make it use their existing back-ends for storage.


* Provide a way for users to write out-of-tree Chunk Store Implementations.
* Use standard protocols like gRPC for communication.
* Provide a new client which talks to the new storage systems.
* Provide easily configurable storage plugins.
