<br/><br/>
Hey! Vineeth here, I am a student. I love to explore new tech and spend time in learning new things which come on my way and take opportunities which cross my path. Am also a member of kubernetes community.

- I interned with Google Summer of Code with The Postgres Operator. You can know more about my GSoC work [here](https://github.com/VineethReddy02/GSoC-Kubectl-Plugin-for-Postgres-Operator-tracker)

- I worked with OpenText as an intern for 3 months.

- Feel free to reach out to me in organising tech meetups in and around Hyderabad. Would love to make things happen.
