      <description>Cortex provides horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant, long term storage for Prometheus. Loki is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. Cortex &amp;amp; Loki are designed in same lines but they differ in the data that flows through this systems i.e metrics vs logs
Recently, I have been working on implementing a gRPC based storage system for cortex. which offers plugin your own database add-on feature for storing the metrics.</description>

      <title>gRPC store for Cortex</title>

      <description>Cortex, being a Distributed, Multi-Tenant Prometheus off-loads the storage to battle-tested databases like Cassandra, BigTable, etc. All the time-series data is converted into chunks. The chunk store essentially contains two parts i.e Index Store, where index to the chunks are stored &amp;amp; KV Store for the chunks itself for direct access. For Index store, There are multiple types of schemas supported by passing the relevant config through chunk.SchemaConfig. Right now, there are only some storage backends supported but as we are seeing more and more users adopting Cortex in their companies,iItâ€™s important that there is a way for them to extend Cortex to make it use their existing back-ends for storage.</description>
