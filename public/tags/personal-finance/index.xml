      <description>Money plays a vital in everyone&amp;rsquo;s life and I wanted to understand the concepts around it and how it impacts our lives. In this blog post I will write all my notes &amp;amp; take aways from each chapter of the book.
No one&amp;rsquo;s crazy The difference I noticed frequently is the choices I make and the way I think to spend, save money is totally different when compared to my friends and others.</description>

I am no way happy with the size of the chocolate and the thought in my mind was haunting me I gave the same 5 rupees and now the size of chocolate is half the size I bought first time.</description>
