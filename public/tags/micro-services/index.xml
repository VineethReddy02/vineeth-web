      <description>gRPC gRPC is a RPC platform initially developed by Google and now a project under CNCF. The letters gRPC are a recursive acronym which means, gRPC Remote Procedure Call.
gRPC has two parts, the gRPC protocol, and the data serialization. By default gRPC utilizes Protobuf for serialization, but it is pluggable with any form of serialization you wish to use, with some caveats.
HTTP/2 gRPC supports several built in features inherited from http2, such as compressing headers, persistent single TCP connections, cancellation and timeout contracts between client and server.</description>
